### 📖 Project Overview

**ELECTOTIME** is a mission-critical software engineered to modernize HR operations. It bridges the gap between **ZKTeco Biometric Hardware** and administrative decision-making.

By automating the extraction of logs from fingerprint devices, the system eliminates manual errors, prevents "ghost worker" fraud, and auto-generates monthly payroll documents using Python.
